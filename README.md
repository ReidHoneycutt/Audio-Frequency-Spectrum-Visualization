# Audio-Frequency-Spectrum-Visualization
This is a nice aesthetic for visualizing audio frequency bands (a graphic representation of the sound timbre) in 2 dimensions. The one in the picture below uses 512 frequency bands. 

The synopsis of this program is that 2 variables, theta1 and theta2 are each mapped to a color between (0, 0, 0) and (255, 255, 255). This program uses the FFT class from the processing sound library.
